# === docker-compose.yml (Template for a SINGLE Drone Raspberry Pi) ===
#
# CONTEXT: This file is configured for Drone 3 (drone3), intended to run on its
# dedicated hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi). It assumes drone1 and drone2 are
# potentially running in a separate SITL environment.
#
# Place this file in the root of the ws_droneOS workspace on the target RPi.
# Customize the placeholders below FOR EACH DRONE before running 'docker-compose up -d'.
# USE THE VALUES THAT MATCH YOUR SPECIFIC HARDWARE AND CONFIGURATION.
# run the command: docker-compose up -d
#
version: '3.8' # Defines the compose file version
