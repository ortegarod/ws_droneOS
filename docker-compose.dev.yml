# === docker-compose.dev.yml (SITL Development Setup) ===
#
# This file configures the development environment for PX4 SITL simulation.
# It uses UDP communication for the Micro XRCE-DDS Agent to connect to PX4 SITL.
#
# By default, it's configured for a single drone (drone1) with:
# - ROS 2 node name: drone1
# - Drone name: drone1
# - PX4 namespace: /fmu/ (for MAV_SYS_ID=1)
# - MAVLink System ID: 1
#
# MULTI-DRONE SETUP:
# To run multiple drones in SITL:
# 1. Copy this file for each additional drone (e.g., docker-compose.dev.drone2.yml)
# 2. Change the service name to be unique (e.g., drone_core2)
# 3. Update the container_name to be unique (e.g., drone_core_node2)
# 4. Update the command section for each drone with its specific configuration:
#    - __node: Unique ROS 2 node name (e.g., drone2)
#    - drone_name: Logical drone name (e.g., drone2)
#    - px4_namespace: PX4 topic namespace (e.g., /px4_1/fmu/ for MAV_SYS_ID=2)
#    - mav_sys_id: Unique MAVLink System ID (e.g., 2)
#
# Run with: docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
#
