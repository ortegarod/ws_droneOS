current context:

ground station running docker-compose.ground.yml
drone running docker-compose.yml

both run tailscale VPN

ground station uses web_interface/frontend (http://localhost:3000/) to send commands to drone - see /web_interface/frontend

ALSO must receive ack response

give me fastdds configs for both (one file for each) to make sure setup work
